🌌 Mecasimetra

**Own Time. Simulate Memory. Collapse Decisions.**

Mecasimetra is a capital-intelligent technology company building the future of intelligent systems through a new computational paradigm — one governed by **time, entropy, and ownership**.

At its core is **MecaSim**, a chronoentropic decision simulation engine that models memory, decay, and probabilistic reasoning using the laws of entropy and reinforcement.

## 🧠 Vision

Mecasimetra seeks to transform decision-making across domains — from capital allocation and system design to cognitive automation and autonomous reasoning. It’s not just AI — it’s **time-aware, entropy-driven intelligence.**

We believe decisions are **not binary**, but probabilistic. They decay. They collapse. They must be **earned, reinforced, or forgotten.**

## 🧬 Core Theories

### 📉 Quantum Ownership Strategy (QOS)

A multidimensional, probabilistic decision-making model built on:

- **Superposition** of capital or memory states
- **Entropy decay** over time
- **Reinforcement feedback loops**
- **Collapse of decisions** based on probabilistic memory weight

### 🧠 Chronoentropic Decision Memory (CDM)

A memory system where signals decay in value unless reinforced — modeling attention, learning, and forgetting.

### ⚡ Chronoentropic Signal Engine (CSE)

A high-performance Rust engine that:
- Processes 50,000+ signals/sec
- Computes entropy-weighted relevance
- Ranks, decays, and collapses signals in real time

## 🚀 Roadmap

All future systems will be powered by the MecaSim core.
