# Mecasimetra

üåå Vision

> Mecasimetra seeks to transform decision-making across domains: from capital allocation and system design to adaptive cognition and autonomous reasoning. It‚Äôs not just AI ‚Äî it‚Äôs time-aware, entropy-driven intelligence.

> Mecasimetra is a capital-intelligent technology company that builds cognitive infrastructures governed by time, entropy, and ownership logic. It pioneers the Quantum Ownership Strategy (QOS) ‚Äî a multidimensional, probabilistic decision-making framework that treats decisions like quantum states, collapsing based on entropy, memory, and reinforcement.

### Core Innovations

1. Quantum Ownership Strategy (QOS)
A proprietary financial and decision-theoretic model that uses:


*** Superposition of capital states. Entropy decay and reinforcement. Probabilistic  memory collapse. Multidimensional signal weighting.


2. Chronoentropic Decision Memory (CDM)
A temporal memory layer that tracks signal importance over time, modeling decision momentum through entropy and reinforcement loops.


3. Chronoentropic Signal Engine (CSE)

*** Processes 50,000+ signals/sec. Real-time entropy-based ranking ***


### Future Projects

4. Meca Linux

*** Mecasimetra‚Äôs proprietary OS. Built on a Quantum Chronoentropic Kernel (qCD-Kernel)
Features a Chronoentropic Quantum Memory Scheduler (CQMS). Geometric UI, purple penguin mascot, and the slogan: ‚ÄúOwn Time.‚Äù
